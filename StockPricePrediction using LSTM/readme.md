Here, I used RNN and LSTMs to predict the stock prices of google stocks, taken from yahoo finance. The compiling time of the layers is about 1hr so be patientfull, as each epoch took about 51seconds on an avergae, and I trained the model for 100epochs. Also, we can capture more non-linearity by increasing the number of layers, which would although increase the level of accuracy but at the cost of evaluating time.
