# About
Used CNN architecture to classify Dogs and Cats images with 88% accuracy, then used several regularisation techniques like adding dropuout layers, data augmentation, batch-normalization to further improve the acccuracy score. Used google collab instead of juypter notebook, to reduce the runtime of the training process by using GPU. Also the dataset used is or large size, so downloading the dataset locally and then reuploading it in juypter was tedious, hence I went with Google Collab.
